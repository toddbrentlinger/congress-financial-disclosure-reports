- ReportListing.filingDate and ReportListing.docID can be sent to Report instead of saving property in ReportListing.
filingDate is saved twice and docID fits more with Report instead of ReportListing.
However, ReportListing can be created without creating Report and ReportListing will need the docID to create the
Report at another time. Could the same apply for filingDate or can it be used in Report only?

- Create AmountRange class (used in Transaction class to replace 'amount' property) 
to get integer values for money to be used to compare if needed

- Could create base class extended by Report and ReportListing.
Similarities:
    - __eq__: both compare docID and then the rest of the values
    - docID, filingDate: both share these properties
    - class methods: initCollection(), addToCollection()
